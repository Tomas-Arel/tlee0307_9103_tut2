# Imaging Technique Inspiration 

## Long Exposure Photography

The technique that I draw inspiration from is long exposure photography, specifically the idea of creating blurred/streaking effects through moving objects. These streaks are typically created using light in a dark envrionment.

I believe this technique can be used to created interesting results in Time-Based, Perlin noise and randomness and User Input animations.

The streaks could be used to highlight/improve/draw focus to specific areas of an artwork while also adding another layer to the artwork.

# Coding Technique 
## Three.js

Three.js can be used to create 3D animated computer graphics. The coding technique I have found is used to simulate the light trails you would see from a car and can serve as inspiration for similar effects that can be created. 

Inspiration can be drawn to simulate light movement that can be used to highlight parts of the chosen artwork.
